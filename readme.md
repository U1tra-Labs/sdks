# Ultra SDKs
A collection of SDKs developed internally for use by both Ultra dev team and the public.
These SDKs are for both internal services (Ground Control, Smart Lend, etc.) and interacting with external services such as Kamino, Marginfi, Solend, Drift, and others.

### Maintenance 
This repository is maintained primarily by:
```
- Morgan Metz <morgan.metz@eyekon.xyz>
```
Feel free to open issues and pull requests for updates to protocol SDKs, or any feedback/improvements to internal SDKs. 

### Organization 
All Rust packages go in `crates`, Node packages in `packages`, and any executable source in `tools`
